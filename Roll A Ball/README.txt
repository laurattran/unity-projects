The special features of my game are the side instructions that give you the options of One Player, Two Player, Restart, and Exit. It also features a random respawning feature for the pickups for the two player modes.

One Player mode - control the player ("hedgehog") using the arrow keys for directional movement and space to jump

Two Player mode - Player 1 is on the left, Player 2 is on the right.

Player 1 Controls: WASD keys for Up, Left, Down, Right respectively; G is for jump

Player 2 Controls: arrow keys for directional movement, "/" button is for jump

Extra Credit Attempt:
I attempted to do game announcements, however the only working announcement I was able to finish was the declaration of time over as well as the final winner of the game. 

I did this by comparing several Text elements as well as parsing the relevant Text elements for numerical values in determining the final winner.
